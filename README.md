This is an application for shortening urls, analogue [bit.ly](https://bit.ly). 

## Installing app

Before starting the application, you must install all dependencies:

`yarn install`

After that you need to rename `default*.json` to `default.json`, then enter your data. Make sure that Redis and MongoDB are installed and accessible.

After that in the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Then go to `localhost:7000/short` and use.
